# ELK Stack Security Monitoring Lab

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up and configure an **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fluent Bit, Winlogbeat) to collect, process, and visualize logs for **security monitoring**.  
It serves as a practical **lab guide** for students, SOC analysts, and cybersecurity enthusiasts looking to gain hands-on experience with **log management and SIEM-based detection**.

## üöÄ Features
- Install & configure **Elasticsearch** and **Kibana** on Ubuntu  
- Configure **Fluent Bit** for log forwarding  
- Configure **Winlogbeat** for Windows event logs  
- Integrate data sources into the ELK pipeline  
- Create **KQL detection rules** in Kibana SIEM  
- Simulate & detect suspicious activity (e.g., disabling firewall)  

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- VMware / VirtualBox  
- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04 ISO  
- Windows 10/11 ISO  
- 16 GB RAM, 60 GB Disk, 4 CPU cores  


**The project is organized into six main phases:**
1. **Elasticsearch** ‚Äì Install and configure the core engine that indexes and stores log data.  
2. **Kibana** ‚Äì Deploy the visualization interface and connect it with Elasticsearch.  
3. **Integration** ‚Äì Link Kibana with Elasticsearch using enrollment tokens and verification codes.  
4. **Fluent Bit** ‚Äì Configure log forwarding from Linux systems into Elasticsearch.  
5. **Winlogbeat** ‚Äì Forward Windows event logs to Elasticsearch for centralized monitoring.  
6. **Threat Detection** ‚Äì Create custom KQL rules in Kibana SIEM and simulate suspicious activity (e.g., disabling the firewall) to generate alerts.  

Together, these phases deliver a fully functional ELK Stack for log ingestion, visualization, and basic security monitoring.
